# Cell2Sentence

Cell2Sentence is a novel method for adapting large language models to single-cell transcriptomics. We transform single-cell RNA sequencing data into sequences of gene names ordered by expression level, termed "cell sentences". This repository provides scripts and examples for converting cells to cell sentences, fine-tuning language models, and converting outputs back to expression values.
